# PapaGreet

PapaGreet is a simple World of Warcraft addon that allows players to greet and bid farewell to other players in the game. This code was generated by me with the help of OpenAI for entertainment purposes.

## Installation

To install PapaGreet, follow these steps:

1. Download the PapaGreet.zip file from the releases page.
2. Extract the contents of the zip file to your World of Warcraft `Interface/AddOns` directory.
3. Restart World of Warcraft or use the `/reload` command to load the addon.

## Usage

PapaGreet adds a button to the center of the screen. Left clicking the button will send a random greeting and emote to the say channel, and right clicking the button will send a random goodbye and emote to the say channel.

The greeting and goodbye messages, as well as the corresponding emotes, can be customized through the PapaGreet menu. To access the menu, right click the PapaGreet button. From the menu, you can choose from different sets of greeting and goodbye messages and emotes, or create your own custom set.

The PapaGreet button can be moved by holding down the middle mouse button and released by letting go of the middle mouse button.
